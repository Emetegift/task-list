# Task Manager

This is a simple task manager web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to add, remove, and filter tasks. The tasks are also stored locally, so they persist even when the browser is closed.

## Getting Started

To use the task manager, simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

```bash
open index.html
```

## Features

### Add Task

To add a task, enter the task in the input field and click the "Add Task" button or press Enter.

### Remove Task

To remove a task, click on the delete icon next to the task. A confirmation prompt will appear to ensure you want to delete the task.

### Clear All Tasks

To clear all tasks, click the "Clear Tasks" button. A confirmation prompt will appear to ensure you want to clear all tasks.

### Filter Tasks

To filter tasks, enter text in the filter input field. The task list will dynamically update to show only tasks that match the entered text.

## Local Storage

The tasks are stored locally using the browser's local storage. This means that tasks will persist even if you close the browser tab or refresh the page.
